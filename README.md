# Brewery [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/albertodotcom/brewery.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/albertodotcom/brewery)
A teeny tiny wrapper around the awesome [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) that writes your **brew** and **cask** formulas in a `.breweryfile.json` so that you can save it in your `dotfiles`

## Usage
Install `brewery` globally via `npm` or `yarn`
```
npm install -g brewery
```
or
```
yarn global add brewery
```
then take all your brew and brew cask already installed formulas and create `.breweryfile.json` in your `HOME` folder 
```
brewery init
```

for help run `brewery`
```
